1.  Rock Ridge SF (Sparse file) entries don't work for parsing or generation.
2.  Large files (up to 4GB-1) don't work, but should.
3.  Support for UDF.
4.  High-level documentation.
5.  Potentially optimize reshuffle_extents() by rewriting in Cython.
6.  Add a test for proper encoding of Joliet strings.
7.  Add a test for symlink to root.
8.  Add tests to ensure that non-zero length symlinks get dealt with properly
    both for parsing and for writing back out (don't write them out, they have
    bogus data).
9.  Add tests to ensure that Rock Ridge CE records are the very last record in
    the Rock Ridge extensions (some OSs, like FreeBSD, doesn't like them if
    they aren't the last one).
10. Add a test for Rockridge RR entries in 1.12 version ISOs.  This isn't
    technically allowed by the standard, but we have seen it in the wild, so
    we should have a test to make sure we don't break it.
11. Add a test for "bare" El Torito section entries.  The El Torito standard
    requires that section entries beyond the initial entry all start with a
    section header, but we've seen ISOs in the wild where this isn't the case.
    Add a test to ensure that these entries still work.
12. Refactor the Rock Ridge new() method so that we don't pass everything in
    a single call, but instead call new() to just generate the basic data,
    then call individual methods to set things in it.  That will make the API
    more manageable.
13. The genisoimage documentation claims it can "hide" files or directories (what
    pycdlib calls "hard linking/unlinking").  Currently, pycdlib only allows
    unlinking files.  We should look into whether we should support this.
14. Add a test for when the El Torito boot catalog record is in a Rock Ridge
    Continuation Entry.
15. Add a test for when the El Torito boot catalog record is in a Rock Ridge
    relocated directory record.
