1.  Rock Ridge SF (Sparse file) entries don't work for parsing or generation.
2.  Support for UDF.
3.  High-level documentation.
4.  Add a test for proper encoding of Joliet strings.
5.  Add a test for symlink to root.
6.  Add tests to ensure that non-zero length symlinks get dealt with properly
    both for parsing and for writing back out (don't write them out, they have
    bogus data).
7.  Add tests to ensure that Rock Ridge CE records are the very last record in
    the Rock Ridge extensions (some OSs, like FreeBSD, doesn't like them if
    they aren't the last one).
8.  Add a test for Rockridge RR entries in 1.12 version ISOs.  This isn't
    technically allowed by the standard, but we have seen it in the wild, so
    we should have a test to make sure we don't break it.
9.  Add a test for "bare" El Torito section entries.  The El Torito standard
    requires that section entries beyond the initial entry all start with a
    section header, but we've seen ISOs in the wild where this isn't the case.
    Add a test to ensure that these entries still work.
10. The genisoimage documentation claims it can "hide" files or directories (what
    pycdlib calls "hard linking/unlinking").  Currently, pycdlib only allows
    unlinking files.  We should look into whether we should support this.
11. Add a test for when the El Torito boot catalog record is in a Rock Ridge
    Continuation Entry.
12. Add a test for when the El Torito boot catalog record is in a Rock Ridge
    relocated directory record.
13. Add a test for padding in the XA records.
14. Break the API for progress_cb(), by making sure the user always has to
    have a function with a 3rd opaque argument.
15. Allow removal of El Torito entries without removing El Torito altogether.
    To do this, we'll need to look up the bootfile when removing and only
    remove the entry that corresponds to it, or the whole thing if it is
    the initial entry.
16. Break the API for add_file/rm_file/add_directory/rm_directory and split
    out adding and removing ISO/RR from adding and removing Joliet.  Since
    they are in two completely separate namespaces, this only makes sense.
    This should probably mostly fallback into a wrapper around the hard_link
    APIs, and should make the rm_file/rm_directory commands in pycdlib-explorer
    do the correct thing.
17. Support alternate Joliet UCS levels (1, 2, and 3 all exist).  This will
    allow us to implement pycdlib-genisoimage compatiblity with the -ucs
    flag.
