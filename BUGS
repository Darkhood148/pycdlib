1.  We can't currently generate Rock Ridge CL (Child Link), PL (Parent Link),
    and RE (relocated directory) entries when we need them.
2.  Rock Ridge SF (Sparse file) entries don't work for parsing or generation.
3.  Large files (up to 4GB-1) don't work, but should.
4.  We need to add tests for Joliet + Eltorito.
5.  We need to add tests for Joliet + Eltorito + RockRidge.
6.  Need to support ISO9660:1999 (ISO9660 version 2, ISO level 4).
7.  Support for UDF.
8.  Fix Rock Ridge SL (symlink) entries.  Our current implementation is
    more-or-less modeled after the genisoimage one, which is quite buggy.  We
    should probably use separate SL records for very long symlinks.
9.  PyDoc documentation.
10. Examples/usage documentation.
11. More tests.
