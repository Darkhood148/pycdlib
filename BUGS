1.  Rock Ridge SF (Sparse file) entries don't work for parsing or generation.
2.  Large files (up to 4GB-1) don't work, but should.
3.  Support for UDF.
4.  Make pyiso-explorer deal with Joliet properly.
5.  Example programs.
6.  High-level documentation.
7.  PyPI?
8.  Potentially optimize reshuffle_extents() by rewriting in Cython.
9.  Implement EFI for the isohybrid support.
10. Add a test for proper encoding of Joliet strings.
11. Be consistent about where padding is done; in the individual record()
    methods, or in write().
12. Add a test for symlink to root.
13. Implement El Torito Floppy and Hard Drive emulated booting.
14. Implement lazy evaluation.  We can speed up the initial parse of existing
    ISOs by skipping walk_directories and only lazily evaluating the structure
    as we need it.  This would drastically speed things up for read-only
    operations, but wouldn't make much difference for read-write operations.
    Not sure if it is worth the complexity.
15. Add a way to extract the El Torito initial entry.
